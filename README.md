# Predictive Modeling for Agriculture

This repository contains code for a predictive modeling project in the field of agriculture. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can recommend suitable crops based on various environmental factors such as nutrient levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `PREDICTIVE_MODELING_FOR_AGRICULTURE.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a predictive model using logistic regression.

- `Crop_recommendation.csv`: This CSV file is the dataset used for training the predictive model. It contains information about the nutrient levels and environmental factors for different crops.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code in the Jupyter Notebook:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To run the code, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the files.
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Open the `PREDICTIVE_MODELING_FOR_AGRICULTURE.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and build the predictive model.
5. You can modify the code or experiment with different machine learning algorithms to improve the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project (`Crop_recommendation.csv`) contains the following columns:

- N: Nitrogen content in the soil (in kg/ha)
- P: Phosphorus content in the soil (in kg/ha)
- K: Potassium content in the soil (in kg/ha)
- temperature: Average temperature (in Â°C)
- humidity: Average relative humidity (in %)
- pH: Soil pH level
- rainfall: Average rainfall (in mm)
- label: Crop label (the target variable)

The label column represents the crop recommended based on the given environmental factors. The dataset contains a total of 2200 entries.

## Code Description

The code in the Jupyter Notebook performs the following tasks:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and sklearn are imported to support data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: The `Crop_recommendation.csv` file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame to work with the data.

3. **Data Exploration**: The `info()` method is used to get an overview of the dataset, including the column names, data types, and memory usage. This helps in understanding the structure of the data.

4. **Checking for Missing Values**: The `isna().sum()` method is used to check for missing values in the dataset. This provides information about the number of missing values in each column.

5. **Data Visualization**: Various visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are used to explore the relationships between different variables and gain insights into the data.

6. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed by performing tasks such as scaling the numerical features using the `preprocessing` module from sklearn and encoding the categorical target variable.

7. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from sklearn. This allows us to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.

8. **Model Training**: A logistic regression model is trained using the training data to predict the crop label based on the environmental factors.

9. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This provides an assessment of the model's performance.

## Conclusion

Predictive modeling in agriculture can help farmers make informed decisions about crop selection based on environmental factors. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to recommend suitable crops using a dataset of nutrient levels and environmental parameters. By understanding the relationships between different variables and training a predictive model, farmers can optimize their crop selection process and potentially improve their agricultural yield.

Feel free to explore the code and dataset, and adapt it to your own agricultural projects or research.
